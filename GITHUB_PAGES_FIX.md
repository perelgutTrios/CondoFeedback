# GitHub Pages Configuration Fix

## Issue
The GitHub Pages is showing the README.md content instead of the React app.

## Solution
You need to configure GitHub Pages to use the correct source branch.

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Go to https://github.com/perelgutTrios/CondoFeedback
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (in the left sidebar)

### Step 2: Configure Source
Ensure the following settings:
- **Source**: Deploy from a branch
- **Branch**: `gh-pages`
- **Folder**: `/ (root)`

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
After changing the settings:
1. Click **Save**
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to rebuild the site
3. Visit https://perelguttrios.github.io/CondoFeedback

## Alternative: Force Refresh
If the settings are already correct:
1. Try visiting the URL in an incognito/private browser window
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Wait a few more minutes for DNS propagation

## Verification
The correct page should show:
- ‚úÖ Essex logo at the top
- ‚úÖ "üè¢ Condo Feedback Portal" header
- ‚úÖ Form with Family Name, Unit Number, Topic, etc.
- ‚ùå NOT the README.md content

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ React app built successfully
- ‚úÖ Files deployed to gh-pages branch
- ‚è≥ GitHub Pages configuration may need adjustment

If you still see the README content after 10 minutes, the repository Pages settings need to be checked.
